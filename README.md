# Pure_HTML_Project_1
This project is to showcase that we can create good looking web pages using HTML only! The idea behind is that we can use any designing software to 
customize the background image in such a way so that it looks good even if we use only HTML & no CSS. Although in real life practice we can use CSS
as it is for sure a better choice but, who says that we can't create descent looking web pages using HTML only? This project can really help in learning
the concepts of HTML for beginners. It can be easy as well as challenging to create such web pages that can look as good as using CSS.
