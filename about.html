    <h3>ABOUT THIS PROJECT-</h3>
    <p>This project is to showcase that we can <br> create good looking web pages using <br> HTML only! The idea behind is that we <br> can use any designing software to <br> customize the background image in such <br> a way so that it looks good even if we use<br> only HTML & no CSS. Although in real life<br> practice we can use CSS as it is for sure a<br> better choice but, who says that we can't<br> create descent looking web pages using<br> HTML only? This project can really help<br> in learning the concepts of HTML for<br> beginners. It can be easy as well as<br> challenging to create such web pages<br> that can look as good as using CSS.</p>
